# # Assignment 2 - Q-Learning and Expected Sarsa

# Welcome to Course 2 Programming Assignment 2. In this notebook, you will:
# 
# - Implement Q-Learning with $\epsilon$-greedy action selection
# - Implement Expected Sarsa with $\epsilon$-greedy action selection
# - Investigate how these two algorithms behave on Cliff World (described on page 132 of the textbook)
# 
# We will provide you with the environment and infrastructure to run an experiment (called the experiment program in RL-Glue). This notebook will provide all the code you need to run your experiment and visualise learning performance.
# 
# This assignment will be graded automatically by comparing the behavior of your agent to our implementations of Expected Sarsa and Q-learning. The random seed will be set to avoid different behavior due to randomness. **You should not call any random functions in this notebook.** It will affect the agent's random state and change the results.

# ## Packages

# You will need the following libraries for this assignment. We are using:
# 1. numpy: the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
# 2. scipy: a Python library for scientific and technical computing.
# 3. matplotlib: library for plotting graphs in Python.
# 4. RL-Glue: library for reinforcement learning experiments.
# 
# **Please do not import other libraries** â€” this will break the autograder.

# In this section you will implement and test a Q-Learning agent with $\epsilon$-greedy action selection (Section 6.5 in the textbook). 

# ### Implementation

# ## Section 3:  Solving the Cliff World

# We described the Cliff World environment in the video "Expected Sarsa in the Cliff World" in Lesson 3. This is an undiscounted episodic task and thus we set $\gamma$=1. The agent starts in the bottom left corner of the gridworld below and takes actions that move it in the four directions. Actions that would move the agent off of the cliff incur a reward of -100 and send the agent back to the start state. The reward for all other transitions is -1. An episode terminates when the agent reaches the bottom right corner. 

# <img src="cliffworld.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/>
# 

# Using the experiment program in the cell below we now compare the agents on the Cliff World environment and plot the sum of rewards during each episode for the two agents.
# 
# The result of this cell will be graded. If you make any changes to your algorithms, you have to run this cell again before submitting the assignment.

# The Q-learning agent learns the optimal policy, one that moves along the cliff and reaches the goal in as few steps as possible. However, since the agent does not follow the optimal policy and uses $\epsilon$-greedy exploration, it occasionally falls off the cliff. The Expected Sarsa agent takes exploration into account and follows a safer path. Note this is different from the book. The book shows Sarsa learns the even safer path
#

# Previously we used a fixed step-size of 0.5 for the agents. What happens with other step-sizes? Does this difference in performance persist?

# ## Wrapping up

# Expected Sarsa shows an advantage over Q-learning in this problem across a wide range of step-sizes.
# 
# Congratulations! Now you have:
# 
# - implemented Q-Learning with $\epsilon$-greedy action selection
# - implemented Expected Sarsa with $\epsilon$-greedy action selection
# - investigated the behavior of these two algorithms on Cliff World
